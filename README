Breast Cancer Classification Project
Overview
This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign using various supervised learning algorithms. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is available from the scikit-learn library. It contains:

569 samples with 30 features each.
The target variable is binary:
0: Benign
1: Malignant
Models
The following classification algorithms were implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Performance Comparison
The performance of each model was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The comparison results are summarized below:

Model Performance Summary
Algorithm	Accuracy	Precision (Malignant)	Recall (Malignant)	F1-Score (Malignant)
Logistic Regression	0.9883	0.99	0.99	0.99
Random Forest	0.9649	0.96	0.98	0.97
Decision Tree	0.9240	0.95	0.93	0.94
Support Vector Machine	0.9883	0.98	1.00	0.99
